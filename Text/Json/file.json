I added the missing three and reworked many of the others to 1) maintain balance between light and heavy armor types, 2) make sure the light/heavy status reflects the nature of the enchantment, 3) make dragon priest masks worth having compared to low- or mid-tier armor types, and 3) feature the maximum variety of material types, all while 4) ensuring the material type matches the mask's appearance (with the exception of Miraak, which I left unchanged). Here's the specifics:\r\n\r\nAdded the three other Dragon Priest Masks from Dragonborn:\r\nAhzidal - ScaledHeavy\r\nDukaan - HNordicHigh\r\nZahkriisos - EbonyLight\r\n\r\nChanged some of the materials on the existing Dragon Priest mask entries:\r\nOtar - GoldHeavy (from Glass) - better suited to heavy armor, and doesn't look like glass; glass is blue. The glass mask should probably be:\r\nMorokei - Glass (from Elven) - Krosis is already elven, so this prevents repeats (and it looks great with glass armor).\r\nVokun - LNordicHigh (from Steel Plate) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\nRahgot - OrkishLight (from Orkish) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\n\r\nKicked the stats for some of the other masks up to \"_High\" - nothing's more depressing than a crappy Dragon Priest mask. Specifically:\r\nKonahrik - DwarvenHigh (from Dwarven)\r\nHevnoraak - IronHigh (from Iron)\r\nVolsung - ScaledHigh (from Scaled) - it has a crappy enchantment, so it needs the armor rating boost.\r\nKrosis - ElvenHigh (from Elven)\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with 7 heavy and 6 light masks - Seems balanced.\r\n\r\nTL;DR I expanded and reworked Dragon Priest masks.","distinct":true,"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Derathir/PCaPP/commits/d2e68f31d0a91884c65ec454d5e7c56e1c66c3b3"}]},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:00:39Z"}

I added the missing three and reworked many of the others to 1) maintain balance between light and heavy armor types, 2) make sure the light/heavy status reflects the nature of the enchantment, 3) make dragon priest masks worth having compared to low- or mid-tier armor types, and 3) feature the maximum variety of material types, all while 4) ensuring the material type matches the mask's appearance (with the exception of Miraak, which I left unchanged). Here's the specifics:\r\n\r\nAdded the three other Dragon Priest Masks from Dragonborn:\r\nAhzidal - ScaledHeavy\r\nDukaan - HNordicHigh\r\nZahkriisos - EbonyLight\r\n\r\nChanged some of the materials on the existing Dragon Priest mask entries:\r\nOtar - GoldHeavy (from Glass) - better suited to heavy armor, and doesn't look like glass; glass is blue. The glass mask should probably be:\r\nMorokei - Glass (from Elven) - Krosis is already elven, so this prevents repeats (and it looks great with glass armor).\r\nVokun - LNordicHigh (from Steel Plate) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\nRahgot - OrkishLight (from Orkish) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\n\r\nKicked the stats for some of the other masks up to \"_High\" - nothing's more depressing than a crappy Dragon Priest mask. Specifically:\r\nKonahrik - DwarvenHigh (from Dwarven)\r\nHevnoraak - IronHigh (from Iron)\r\nVolsung - ScaledHigh (from Scaled) - it has a crappy enchantment, so it needs the armor rating boost.\r\nKrosis - ElvenHigh (from Elven)\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with 7 heavy and 6 light masks - Seems balanced.\r\n\r\nTL;DR I expanded and reworked Dragon Priest

There is also an atom feed of the same posts. I included a \"lorem ipsum\" news item to test with but we can (and probably should) replace it with an actual post before merging the PR.\r\n\r\nTo add this, there were a few larger things that I changed:\r\n- I added a \"community\" drop-down that includes the news, project gallery, and contributing menu items. If I had added another without collapsing these, the nav would have been much too wide for smaller screens.\r\n- I deleted the old `_posts` folder and moved the projects to a new `_posts` folder inside the existing projects folder. This both eliminates the need for explicit category definition (because Jekyll derives the set of categories by the directory structure above the posts) and allows us to add multiple post categories and keep them separate.\r\n\r\nNeither of these changes should break anything technically, although we will need to update the \"adding a project\" guide with the new path.\r\n\r\nMy `gh-pages` branch has been updated with these changes as well."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ev3dev/ev3dev.github.io/issues/comments/68488520","html_url":"https://github.com/ev3dev/ev3dev.github.io/pull/37#issuecomment-68488520","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/ev3dev/ev3dev.github.io/issues/37","id":68488520,"user":{"login":"rhempel","id":5571620,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5571620?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhempel","html_url":"https://github.com/rhempel","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhempel/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhempel/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhempel/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhempel/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhempel/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhempel/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhempel/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhempel/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/rhempel/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:01:31Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T15:01:31Z","body":"Yes, thanks very much!

When I use page transitions (like slide), it causes a flicking. Especially in default browser in android phones, flicking is really bad.\r\n\r\nI deeply investigate the jquery-mobile.js to understand when this flickering happens. After spending many hours, I found which code part causes the problem: Enabling/Disabling zoom on just before page transition!\r\n\r\nin jQuery mobile 1.2.0 source codes (line 7211 to 7234):\r\n\r\n$.mobile.zoom = $.extend( {}, {\r\n    enabled: !disabledInitially,\r\n    locked: false,\r\n    disable: function( lock ) {\r\n        if ( !disabledInitially && !$.mobile.zoom.locked ) {\r\n            meta.attr( \"content\", disabledZoom );\r\n            $.mobile.zoom.enabled = false;\r\n            $.mobile.zoom.locked = lock || false;\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n    enable: function( unlock ) {\r\n        if ( !disabledInitially && ( !$.mobile.zoom.locked || unlock === true ) ) {\r\n            meta.attr( \"content\", enabledZoom );\r\n            $.mobile.zoom.enabled = true;\r\n            $.mobile.zoom.locked = false;\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n    restore: function() {\r\n        if ( !disabledInitially ) {\r\n            meta.attr( \"content\", initialContent );\r\n            $.mobile.zoom.enabled = true;\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n});\r\n\r\nI deleted the lines:\r\n\r\nmeta.attr( \"content\", disabledZoom );\r\n\r\nand\r\n\r\nmeta.attr( \"content\", enabledZoom );\r\n\r\n(lines 7216 and 7223)\r\n\r\nThen it worked smoothly without a problem! I don't know if it causes another problem but the problem was changing max-zoom in page transition. In my tests, it worked correctly without any problem.\r\n\r\nI wanted to inform you to consider this problem while changing zoom."},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/comments/68488528","html_url":"https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5431#issuecomment-68488528","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/jquery/jquery-mobile/issues/5431","id":68488528,"user":{"login":"architverma","id":10356336,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10356336?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/architverma","html_url":"https://github.com/architverma","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/architverma/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/architverma/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/architverma/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/architverma/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/architverma/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/architverma/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/architverma/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/architverma/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/architverma/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:01:53Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T15:01:53Z","body":"hi luigi please tell what you did so your 4.1.2 started working properly.\r\nmy android mobile is not working. and each service centre is saying you have touch screen problem."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:01:53Z","org":{"id":70142,"login":"jquery","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/jquery","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/70142?"}}

The Publisher (PubSub) API remained exactly the same and is implemented per your description. Notable changes:\r\n\r\n1. `socket` API in the router. Socket endpoints are now configured via the `socket` macro and house the channel definitions. Channels can also now be scoped based on transport, i.e.:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n  defmodule MyApp.Router do\r\n    use Phoenix.Router\r\n\r\n    socket \"/ws\", MyApp do\r\n      channel \"topic1:*\",  MyChannel\r\n      channel \"baretopic\", MyChannel\r\n      channel \"wsonly:*\",  MyChannel, via: [Phoenix.Transports.WebSocket]\r\n      channel \"lponly:*\",  MyChannel, via: [Phoenix.Transports.LongPoller]\r\n    end\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. The \"topic\" abstraction is now *only a string identifier*. We used to conflate the channel name and topic names. Now `channel \"foo:*\"` refers to the topic \"foo\" and any pattern following \"foo:\". By convention, we use \"topic:subtopic\", but the splat \"*\" does not require a colon.\r\n\r\n3. Likewise, in the channel callbacks, you now match on the topic directly:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n# router\r\nchannel \"rooms:*\", RoomChannel\r\n\r\n# channel\r\ndef join(\"rooms:lobby\", message, socket) do ...\r\ndef join(\"rooms:\" <> room_id, message, socket) do ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. All channel callbacks now accept `socket` as the last argument to more closely follow a GenServer API where the state is held in the last arg and the message is matched int he first.\r\n\r\n5. Transports now use two flavors of messages, `{:socket_reply, %Message{...}}` and `{:socket_broadcast, %Message{...})` to differentiate replies from broadcasts. This was required to support `outgoing` callbacks.\r\n\r\n6. `event` has been renamed to `incoming` and now channel callbacks can filter/intercept/modify broadcasts with an `outgoing` callback for per-socket customization, i.e.:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\ndef incoming(\"new:msg\", %{\"from_id\" => from_id, \"body\" => body}, socket) do\r\n  # broadcast incoming new message to all subscribers\r\n  broadcast socket, \"new:msg\", %{body: body, from_id: from_id}\r\nend\r\n\r\n# each socket's outgoing callback will be triggered for per-socket\r\n# customization of broadcast. Sockets can also not reply to filter broadcasts\r\n# from being relayed.\r\ndef outgoing(\"new:msg\", msg, socket) do\r\n  user = socket.assigns[:user]\r\n\r\n  reply socket, \"new:msg\", Dict.merge(msg,\r\n    is_editable: can_edit?(user, msg.from_id),\r\n    is_friend: is_friend?(user, msg.from_id)\r\n  )\r\nend\r\n\r\n# by default just forward reply\r\ndef outgoing(event, msg, socket) do\r\n  reply socket, event, msg \r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Points of discussion for the 0.8.0 release:\r\n\r\n- Should incoming/outgoing be renamed to a more GenServer'esque API? i.e. `handle_incoming`, `handle_outgoing`? I prefer the current naming, but `handle_` could be more welcoming to newcomers who would find it more familiar to GenServer style.\r\n- Should we embed the `node()` my default in the message to allow per-node filtering? I opted not to since end-users can attach their `node()` themselves in the broadcasted message if they need per-node handling. Subscribers can pick up the message the compare their node().\r\n- Others?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Points of discussion for 0.9.0+:\r\n\r\nAs discussed on IRC, we need to tackle handling missed messages with a configurable backend. Today, the LongPoller requires a cookie session, and clustered nodes. The PubSub also requires clustering. We would like to move towards a configurable store with `last_seen_id` tracking of messages, for replaying messages between client drops, as well as a solution to non-clustered pubsub servers.\r\n\r\nLet me know how it looks!

I'm sorry if revisiting this subject again is annoying.\r\n\r\nTo recall the situation, we can only request binary values using the extended query protocol, and we currently use extended query protocol only in prepared statements. In #370 we already discussed switching to the extended query protocol for non-prepared parameterized queries; this would remove a big chunk of complexity in client-side query rewriting, allow use of binary encoding when receiving values, etc. Once we do this we can also drop text encoding entirely for *sending* values to the database.\r\n\r\nSo after thinking about the whole thing some more, I now think that v3.0 should be a 100% binary-only, extended-query-only provider - I can see no real reasons for maintaining either text encoding or the simple protocol. The new read_refactor branch implements binary encoding for almost all PostgreSQL built-in types, including exotic types such as geometric and networking types, and the few types that haven't been binarized can be done for v3.0.\r\n\r\nNow, the main argument against going binary-only was unknown types - types defined by extensions are unknown to Npgsql so they're binary representation can't be decoded. With text encoding we can at least hand off the string to the user. To address this problem, we can allow a user to turn on a \"text-only\" flag on a command before executing it. This would make Npgsql request all results in text, and the user can access them as strings. The only drawback I can see is that one can't mix text and binary in the same query, so even simple ints have to be accessed as strings. The user has the option of either separating \"unknown-type queries\" from normal queries, or to deal with text representations of known types themselves - IMHO this is a very acceptable situation for the extremely rare unknown type problem (which will become even rarer as we implement support for more and more types).\r\n\r\nNote that as @franciscojunior suggested, the unknown type problem can be partially mitigated also by allowing external type handlers to be registered with Npgsql (although I think it's a bit early to actually allow that in 3.0).\r\n\r\nPros:\r\n* A transparent performance boost thanks to binary encoding. With the current situation, users have to be aware that binary encoding requires preparing the query, the fact that this entails two roundtrips... It's complicated and it involves users in the inner workings of both Npgsql and the PostgreSQL protocol. Making everything binary and extended-protocol makes the performance boost accessible to everyone in a transparent and easy way.\r\n* No more mucking around with locale settings which affect text representations (e.g. lc_monetary for money which causes #163, DateStyle=ISO...). Note that Npgsql users may want to work with PostgreSQL functions which depend on these settings, and Npgsql interferes with them to make text decoding possible.\r\n* No more loss of precision converting floating point values to and from text. Binary \"conversion\" is 100% accurate. (see #324).\r\n* Greatly simplifies our code base: text encoding and the simple protocol can simply be cut out, no more need to maintain two encoding paths for each type, etc. Npgsql becomes very lean and lightweight without losing any real functionality.\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n* Unknown (or text-only) types are a bit clumsy to use - they can't be easily mixed with known types (a query is either all-binary or all-text).\r\n* Multi-resultset queries aren't supported with the extended protocol. We'd have to fake them by sending multiple extended-protocol queries (but this can still be done in a single message, so only one roundtrip).\r\n* There was some mention of the extended protocol being less efficient than the simple protocol. We need to evaluate this with an actual performance test, but I also think the performance gains due to binary encoding should at the very least offset this.\r\n"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/npgsql/npgsql/issues/comments/68488548","html_url":"https://github.com/npgsql/npgsql/issues/447#issuecomment-68488548","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/npgsql/npgsql/issues/447","id":68488548,"user":{"login":"franciscojunior","id":829924,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/829924?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/franciscojunior","html_url":"https://github.com/franciscojunior","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franciscojunior/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franciscojunior/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franciscojunior/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franciscojunior/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franciscojunior/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franciscojunior/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franciscojunior/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franciscojunior/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/franciscojunior/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:03:14Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T15:03:14Z","body":"> In #370 we discussed various aspects of switching to the extended query protocol, and also to binary encoding. @Emill and I discussed this again recently on our gitter channel, and I wanted to get your opinions (@franciscojunior @jbcooley @glenebob). I'm sorry if revisiting this subject again is annoying.\r\n\r\nIt is not annoying at all. I hope I can contribute with the discussion... :)\r\n\r\nAnd first of all, I'm +1 to the binary approach. I'm just worried about the possible compromises we will have to make. I'll talk about that in the comments below...\r\n\r\n> IMHO this is a very acceptable situation for the extremely rare unknown type problem (which will become even rarer as we implement support for more and more types).\r\n\r\nI think so, but we would need to check that. I don't know how many different data types are being used which we would break with that. I think we would only be able to have a good picture of it when we release our first 3.0 version. My suggestion would be to keep the text handling path available and we could remove it as we confirm that our users are using Npgsql ok without big problems regarding query errors. What do you think? \r\nI also liked @Emill idea of defaulting to binary path and fallbacking to text if there is any requisite. \r\nI know it is not ideal :(\r\n\r\n\r\nMy main concern right now the the not only the amount of breakage we are heading at here. I'm also worried, after seeing the comments about implicit transactions, BEGIN/COMMIT and multiple statements that we may introduce some *limitations* to the point that users would have to program differently from what they are used to only to be able to use Npgsql. I hope I'm being too much dramatic here. :)\r\n\r\n\r\n> I think it will be a bit problematic with multiple-statement queries in the extended protocol if we just send separate queries. With the simple query protocol, the statements seem to be done inside a transaction.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering how jdbc guys work on this situation. I may be wrong, but I think they use the extended protocol exclusively. Maybe we could have a look at how they handle this situation and try a similar approach in Npgsql. :)\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n> I actually just had another thought about the unknown type problem. Rather than the \"all-text\" flag I proposed above, we can simply allow the user to specify that the result column at a certain index should be returned as text. Npgsql will then request binary encoding for all columns by default, except those which have been flagged as text only. When Npgsql receives the results, columns which are transferred as text are simply untouched by Npgsql.\r\n\r\nHmmm, what happens if we handle those unknown types as text and decode them as text and give them to the user? \r\n\r\nAnother idea, would it be possible for us to detect in advance those unknown types and instead of asking the user to flag those columns which need to be text, we could just flag them ourselves, or at least ask them to be all text? This way we would eliminate any user interaction.\r\n\r\n> This means the user can mix-and-match text encoding for unknown types, while benefiting from binary everywhere else (thanks @glenebob for making me think about it). IMHO this really solves the unknown type problem, the user has total flexibility over everything, at the small price of specifying the column numbers that should be simple text.\r\n\r\nExactly! :)\r\n\r\n\r\n> I also noticed that SchemaOnly can be very elegantly implemented by simply executing Parse + Describe Statement + Sync, so I implemented that as well.\r\n\r\nExcellent, @Emill !\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI hope I could contribute a little bit to the discussion."}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:03:14Z","org":{"id":5766497,"login":"npgsql","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/npgsql","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5766497?"}}

I added the missing three and reworked many of the others to 1) maintain balance between light and heavy armor types, 2) make sure the light/heavy status reflects the nature of the enchantment, 3) make dragon priest masks worth having compared to low- or mid-tier armor types, and 3) feature the maximum variety of material types, all while 4) ensuring the material type matches the mask's appearance (with the exception of Miraak, which I left unchanged). Here's the specifics:\r\n\r\nAdded the three other Dragon Priest Masks from Dragonborn:\r\nAhzidal - ScaledHeavy\r\nDukaan - HNordicHigh\r\nZahkriisos - EbonyLight\r\n\r\nChanged some of the materials on the existing Dragon Priest mask entries:\r\nOtar - GoldHeavy (from Glass) - better suited to heavy armor, and doesn't look like glass; glass is blue. The glass mask should probably be:\r\nMorokei - Glass (from Elven) - Krosis is already elven, so this prevents repeats (and it looks great with glass armor).\r\nVokun - LNordicHigh (from Steel Plate) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\nRahgot - OrkishLight (from Orkish) - enchantment is better suited to light armor wearers.\r\n\r\nKicked the stats for some of the other masks up to \"_High\" - nothing's more depressing than a crappy Dragon Priest mask. Specifically:\r\nKonahrik - DwarvenHigh (from Dwarven)\r\nHevnoraak - IronHigh (from Iron)\r\nVolsung - ScaledHigh (from Scaled) - it has a crappy enchantment, so it needs the armor rating boost.\r\nKrosis - ElvenHigh (from Elven)\r\n\r\nThis leaves us with 7 heavy and 6 light masks - Seems balanced.\r\n\r\nTL;DR I expanded and reworked Dragon Priest masks.","created_at":"2015-01-01T15:01:06Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T15:03:18Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"4c5e46652ee9c081144d8da174f4b0f65de76ec2","assignee":null,"milestone":null,"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Raulfin/PCaPP/pulls/1/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Raulfin/PCaPP/pulls/1/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Raulfin/PCaPP/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Raulfin/PCaPP/issues/1/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/Raulfin/PCaPP/statuses/d2e68f31d0a91884c65ec454d5e7c56e1c66c3b3","head":{"label":"Derathir:patch-1","ref":"patch-1","sha":"d2e68f31d0a91884c65ec454d5e7c56e1c66c3b3","user":{"login":"Derathir","id":10364471,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10364471?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir","html_url":"https://github.com/Derathir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":28687886,"name":"PCaPP","full_name":"Derathir/PCaPP","owner":{"login":"Derathir","id":10364471,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/10364471?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir","html_url":"https://github.com/Derathir","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Derathir/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/Derathir/PCaPP","description":"Repository

For this the script will create a new file \"boot.img-Args.txt\" - as example for boot image - will copy in it values like this: \"--base 0x10000000 --pagesize 2048 --kernel_offset 0x00008000 --ramdisk_offset 0x01000000 --second_offset 0x00f00000 --tags_offset 0x00000100\". They will be shown on the screen also. At repacking all these are passed in command and the resulting image will work in these new phones. It has no impact on older platforms - I tested this myself, and for new platform was tested in zopo zp999 thread. Additionally I created a new script which will only show image infos, if there is no need to unpack it. I compiled again all binaries modules to support these extra arguments, and also I compiled the required modules for info script. I couldn't do it for OSX, but I have the repo with boot-info in my gihub if you can build it. Also mkbootimg has to be compiled again for OSX to accept extra arguments.\r\nLiviu"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bgcngm/mtk-tools/issues/comments/68488584","html_url":"https://github.com/bgcngm/mtk-tools/pull/8#issuecomment-68488584","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/bgcngm/mtk-tools/issues/8","id":68488584,"user":{"login":"bgcngm","id":1696148,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1696148?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgcngm","html_url":"https://github.com/bgcngm","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgcngm/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgcngm/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgcngm/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgcngm/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgcngm/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgcngm/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgcngm/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgcngm/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/bgcngm/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:05:24Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T15:05:24Z","body":"Yeah, it's a good idea, to show more info when repacking.

I am of course talking only about the segments targeted for this component and not the segments before that. Joomla can do what it wants with that.  \r\n\r\nI know this probably has to do with slug or similar, but whatever the reason, this is forcing component developers to use that \"concept\" of routing.  This concept should be up to the component developer. \r\n\r\nBut OK, if any developer doesn't agree with the above concept responsibilty, then one should be consistent and make it so that the segments returned by the build function are also changed accordingly after building them. Than at least for someone not knowing this concept, both functions in router.php are complying to each other.  \r\n\r\nFYI:\r\nThis \"bug\" is already here since a long time it seems and people have changed the dash back to a colon in their routing.  (Isn't that a bit inefficient, and again inconsistent?).\r\nHere is one example, but more can be found via google:\r\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/questions/13471360/joomla-component-sef-links-on-and-jrequestgetvar-not-returning-variables-fro\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:05:32Z","org":{"id":751633,"login":"joomla","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/orgs/joomla","avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/751633?"}}

The Publisher (PubSub) API remained exactly the same and is implemented per your description. Notable changes:\r\n\r\n1. `socket` API in the router. Socket endpoints are now configured via the `socket` macro and house the channel definitions. Channels can also now be scoped based on transport, i.e.:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n  defmodule MyApp.Router do\r\n    use Phoenix.Router\r\n\r\n    socket \"/ws\", MyApp do\r\n      channel \"topic1:*\",  MyChannel\r\n      channel \"baretopic\", MyChannel\r\n      channel \"wsonly:*\",  MyChannel, via: [Phoenix.Transports.WebSocket]\r\n      channel \"lponly:*\",  MyChannel, via: [Phoenix.Transports.LongPoller]\r\n    end\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. The \"topic\" abstraction is now *only a string identifier*. We used to conflate the channel name and topic names. Now `channel \"foo:*\"` refers to the topic \"foo\" and any pattern following \"foo:\". By convention, we use \"topic:subtopic\", but the splat \"*\" does not require a colon.\r\n\r\n3. Likewise, in the channel callbacks, you now match on the topic directly:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\n# router\r\nchannel \"rooms:*\", RoomChannel\r\n\r\n# channel\r\ndef join(\"rooms:lobby\", message, socket) do ...\r\ndef join(\"rooms:\" <> room_id, message, socket) do ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. All channel callbacks now accept `socket` as the last argument to more closely follow a GenServer API where the state is held in the last arg and the message is matched int he first.\r\n\r\n5. Transports now use two flavors of messages, `{:socket_reply, %Message{...}}` and `{:socket_broadcast, %Message{...})` to differentiate replies from broadcasts. This was required to support `outgoing` callbacks.\r\n\r\n6. `event` has been renamed to `incoming` and now channel callbacks can filter/intercept/modify broadcasts with an `outgoing` callback for per-socket customization, i.e.:\r\n\r\n```elixir\r\ndef incoming(\"new:msg\", %{\"from_id\" => from_id, \"body\" => body}, socket) do\r\n  # broadcast incoming new message to all subscribers\r\n  broadcast socket, \"new:msg\", %{body: body, from_id: from_id}\r\nend\r\n\r\n# each socket's outgoing callback will be triggered for per-socket\r\n# customization of broadcast. Sockets can also not reply to filter broadcasts\r\n# from being relayed.\r\ndef outgoing(\"new:msg\", msg, socket) do\r\n  user = socket.assigns[:user]\r\n\r\n  reply socket, \"new:msg\", Dict.merge(msg,\r\n    is_editable: can_edit?(user, msg.from_id),\r\n    is_friend: is_friend?(user, msg.from_id)\r\n  )\r\nend\r\n\r\n# by default just forward reply\r\ndef outgoing(event, msg, socket) do\r\n  reply socket, event, msg \r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Points of discussion for the 0.8.0 release:\r\n\r\n- Should incoming/outgoing be renamed to a more GenServer'esque API? i.e. `handle_incoming`, `handle_outgoing`? I prefer the current naming, but `handle_` could be more welcoming to newcomers who would find it more familiar to GenServer style.\r\n- Should we embed the `node()` my default in the message to allow per-node filtering? I opted not to since end-users can attach their `node()` themselves in the broadcasted message if they need per-node handling. Subscribers can pick up the message the compare their node().\r\n- Others?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Points of discussion for 0.9.0+:\r\n\r\nAs discussed on IRC, we need to tackle handling missed messages with a configurable backend. Today, the LongPoller requires a cookie session, and clustered nodes. The PubSub also requires clustering. We would like to move towards a configurable store with `last_seen_id` tracking of messages, for replaying messages between client drops, as well as a solution to non-clustered pubsub servers.\r\n\r\nLet me know how it looks!

Instead of a standalone script, JIT is simply another Renderer which inherits all Symphony functionality. This was made possible by Symphony 2.5, which added the `ModifySymphonyLauncher` delegate. This alleviates the major limitation of JIT in that it can now use delegates.\r\n\r\nI believe this change would make it possible to fix the following by adding in delegates, or with minor changes to the code:\r\n\r\n- Added other modes easily as they can be dropped into `workspace/jit-image-manipulation/filters`, #73\r\n- Adding different cache types, #69\r\n- Allowing image retrieval to come from different sources, #97\r\n\r\nThe code in this pull request is far from release quality, but I've pushed up in response to [the comment](https://github.com/symphonycms/symphony-2/issues/2266#issuecomment-68440077) by @jensscherbl that others could probably run with this better than I can. Math and image manipulation are not my strengths, so I'm happy for interested parties to carry on this work and work towards a 2.0 release!"},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symphonycms/jit_image_manipulation/issues/comments/68488601","html_url":"https://github.com/symphonycms/jit_image_manipulation/pull/98#issuecomment-68488601","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/symphonycms/jit_image_manipulation/issues/98","id":68488601,"user":{"login":"jensscherbl","id":1640033,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/1640033?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/jensscherbl","html_url":"https://github.com/jensscherbl","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jensscherbl/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jensscherbl/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jensscherbl/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jensscherbl/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jensscherbl/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jensscherbl/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jensscherbl/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jensscherbl/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/jensscherbl/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:06:05Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T15:06:05Z","body":"The launcher thing is interesting.

The upstream build process has changed in order to make this customization simpler. Now the suggested method of renaming is:\r\n\r\n```shell\r\nexport GYP_DEFINES=\"product_name=MyApp project_name=myapp\"\r\n./script/update.py\r\n./script/build.py -C Release -t myapp\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn grunt-build-atom-shell 1.1.4, attempting to compile atom-shell 0.20.3 will throw the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>> Running: python script/bootstrap.py\r\n>> Running: python script/build.py -c Release -t triple-triad-atom\r\n>> ninja: error: unknown target 'triple-triad-atom'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe 'atom.gyp' file ends up containing:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    'project_name%': 'atom',\r\n    'product_name%': 'Atom',\r\n```\r\n\r\nDealing with quoting and interpolation for multiple options in a single string feels weird for me, so it might just be simpler to add another two replace statements for the new form. I haven't looked at the changes in depth to see what else might have changed (or if those defines are used in other places).\r\n\r\nIf I get un-lazy I'll patch and submit a pull quest, but considering i'm both lazy and hung over you'll probably get to it first. :laughing: "},"comment":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paulcbetts/grunt-build-atom-shell/issues/comments/68488610","html_url":"https://github.com/paulcbetts/grunt-build-atom-shell/issues/7#issuecomment-68488610","issue_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/paulcbetts/grunt-build-atom-shell/issues/7","id":68488610,"user":{"login":"ttilley","id":9715,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/9715?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttilley","html_url":"https://github.com/ttilley","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttilley/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttilley/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttilley/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttilley/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttilley/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttilley/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttilley/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttilley/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/ttilley/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:06:31Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T15:06:31Z","body":"It appears that there's a typo in atom-shell upstream that mixes up product_name and project_name in one place, breaking the build anyways. \r\n\r\nThis is what i'm doing to work around it locally:\r\n\r\n```diff\r\ndiff --git i/tasks/build-atom-shell-task.coffee w/tasks/build-atom-shell-task.coffee\r\nindex 66f8812..a5d42a1 100644\r\n--- i/tasks/build-atom-shell-task.coffee\r\n+++ w/tasks/build-atom-shell-task.coffee\r\n@@ -62,16 +62,27 @@ module.exports = (grunt) ->\r\n       .concatMap (x) -> spawnObservable(x)\r\n       .takeLast(1)\r\n \r\n+  envWithGypDefines = (projectName, productName) ->\r\n+    ewg = _.extend {}, process.env\r\n+    ewg.GYP_DEFINES = \"project_name=#{projectName} product_name=#{productName}\"\r\n+    if process.env.GYP_DEFINES?\r\n+      ewg.GYP_DEFINES = \"#{process.env.GYP_DEFINES} #{ewg.GYP_DEFINES}\"\r\n+    ewg\r\n+\r\n   buildAtomShell = (atomShellDir, config, projectName, productName, forceRebuild) ->\r\n+    cmdOptions =\r\n+      cwd: atomShellDir\r\n+      env: envWithGypDefines(projectName, productName)\r\n+\r\n     bootstrapCmd =\r\n       cmd: 'python'\r\n       args: ['script/bootstrap.py']\r\n-      opts: {cwd: atomShellDir}\r\n+      opts: cmdOptions\r\n \r\n     buildCmd =\r\n       cmd: 'python'\r\n       args: ['script/build.py', '-c', config, '-t', projectName]\r\n-      opts: {cwd: atomShellDir}\r\n+      opts: cmdOptions\r\n \r\n     rx.Observable.create (subj) ->\r\n       grunt.verbose.ok \"Rigging atom.gyp to have correct name\"\r\n@@ -81,6 +92,7 @@ module.exports = (grunt) ->\r\n         .replace(\"'project_name': 'atom'\", \"'project_name': '#{projectName}'\")\r\n         .replace(\"'product_name': 'Atom'\", \"'product_name': '#{productName}'\")\r\n         .replace(\"'framework_name': 'Atom Framework'\", \"'framework_name': '#{productName} Framework'\")\r\n+        .replace(\"'<(project_name) Framework'\", \"'<(product_name) Framework'\") # fix upstream typo in 0.20.3\r\n \r\n       grunt.file.write gypFile, atomGyp\r\n```\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:06:31Z"}

Errol,\n\nHappy New Year to you too!\n\nThe reason you get session disconnect is due to tariff plan error you \nhave inserted in your Rates.csv. If you set GroupIntervalStart to 6 the \nrater will not have a rate for the beginning of the interval (1-6) hence \ndropping the call. If you want to have the first 6 seconds of a call \nfree, you need to still define a GroupIntervalStart 0 with a \ncorresponding rate of 0. If you want to charge all but in increments of \n6 seconds, you need to define GroupIntervalStart to 0 and RateIncrement \nto 6.\n\nLet me know if clear enough.\n\nDanB\n\nOn 31.12.2014 16:13,

If the value being filtered exists in the list of known values, the filter will return the value if its a whitelist or `null` if its a blacklist. The opposite will happen if value is not in the list.\r\n\r\n### Whitelist\r\n```php\r\n$whitelist = new \\Zend\\Filter\\Whitelist(array(\r\n    'list' => array('allowed-1', 'allowed-2')\r\n));\r\necho $whitelist->filter('allowed-2');   // => 'allowed-2'\r\necho $whitelist->filter('not-allowed'); // => null\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Blacklist\r\n```php\r\n$blacklist = new \\Zend\\Filter\\Whitelist(array(\r\n    'type' => 'blacklist', // optional, default is 'whitelist'\r\n    'list' => array('not-allowed-1', 'not-allowed-2')\r\n));\r\necho $blacklist->filter('allowed');        // => 'allowed'\r\necho $blacklist->filter('not-allowed-2');  // => null\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Notes  \r\n\r\n1. Maybe calling the filter class `Whitelist` might be counter-intuitive if the desired behavior is that of a blacklist. But I couldn't think of a better way to name the filter, so I'm open to suggestions:\r\n    * Something like \"AllowedList\" would just be a synonym of \"whitelist\". \r\n    * \"List\" would just be too vague.\r\n    * Separate filter classes seemed overkill.\r\n2. I decided to allow only one type of configuration in the constructor (by array of options) just to keep it simple. If you'd like to allow for a more dynamic constructor (like a few other filters do) let me know.\r\n3. Not sure what commit edbc12b is doing in this PR. Looks like its in `master` but not in `develop`.\r\n\r\nSee #6960 for more

However Cargo printed out **NOTHING** helpful to diagnose this problem:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cargo build --verbose\r\n   Compiling hello v0.0.1 (file:///tmp/hello)\r\n     Running `rustc build.rs --crate-name build-script-build --crate-type bin -C prefer-dynamic -g --out-dir /tmp/hello/target/build/hello-77de99f14f3cb8ca --emit=dep-info,link -L /tmp/hello/target -L /tmp/hello/target/deps`\r\n     Running `/tmp/hello/target/build/hello-77de99f14f3cb8ca/build-script-build`\r\n     Running `rustc /tmp/hello/src/lib.rs --crate-name hello --crate-type lib -g -C metadata=77de99f14f3cb8ca -C extra-filename=-77de99f14f3cb8ca --out-dir /tmp/hello/target --emit=dep-info,link -L /tmp/hello/target -L /tmp/hello/target/deps -L /tmp/hello/target/build/hello-77de99f14f3cb8ca/out -l hello:static`\r\nerror: could not find native static library `hello`, perhaps an -L flag is missing?\r\nCould not compile `hello`.\r\n\r\nCaused by:\r\n  Process didn't exit successfully: `rustc /tmp/hello/src/lib.rs --crate-name hello --crate-type lib -g -C metadata=77de99f14f3cb8ca -C extra-filename=-77de99f14f3cb8ca --out-dir /tmp/hello/target --emit=dep-info,link -L /tmp/hello/target -L /tmp/hello/target/deps -L /tmp/hello/target/build/hello-77de99f14f3cb8ca/out -l hello:static` (status=101)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI spent an extra hour figuring out where the problem is, having add some extra code to redirect the output of GCC to a log file.\r\n\r\nI admit that there is a bug in the build script that the status code should be checked. But anyway, there need to be a way to debug this, **or it will be a pain if this happens on a client's computer, causing a complaining mail.**\r\n\r\n## If the user says `--verbose`, do verbose.\r\n\r\nI know that printing a lot of garbage messes the terminal. So it is reasonable that the output of build script is suppressed.\r\n\r\nBut why continuing to suppress the output even if the user says `--verbose`?\r\n\r\nI have read in issue #985 that it may be too noisy with `--verbose`. That's `build.rs`'s stuff. `build.rs` should filter the output so only useful messages are shown, which is not Cargo's duty since Cargo no nothing about which message is useful.\r\n\r\n## Compilation takes time, user may want to see what is going on\r\n\r\nIn the documentation of Cargo, it explained that build scripts may find an extra library or build a library itself.\r\n\r\nOn the latter case, it may take time. It is better to tell the user why the compilation sticks at this point.\r\n\r\n## GCC warnings are really useful\r\n\r\nIf Cargo displays the output only when the build fails, the GCC warnings will be suppressed.\r\n\r\nJust like Rust lints, GCC warnings is usually useful to improve the security of the code.\r\n\r\n## My idea\r\n\r\n1. `stderr` is always on, and `stdout` is off unless `--verbose` is on\r\n\r\n2. Or alternatively, introduce verbosity level\r\n\r\n(P.S.

If the value being filtered exists in the list of known values, the filter will return the value if its a whitelist or `null` if its a blacklist. The opposite will happen if value is not in the list.\r\n\r\n### Whitelist\r\n```php\r\n$whitelist = new \\Zend\\Filter\\Whitelist(array(\r\n    'list' => array('allowed-1', 'allowed-2')\r\n));\r\necho $whitelist->filter('allowed-2');   // => 'allowed-2'\r\necho $whitelist->filter('not-allowed'); // => null\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Blacklist\r\n```php\r\n$blacklist = new \\Zend\\Filter\\Whitelist(array(\r\n    'type' => 'blacklist', // optional, default is 'whitelist'\r\n    'list' => array('not-allowed-1', 'not-allowed-2')\r\n));\r\necho $blacklist->filter('allowed');        // => 'allowed'\r\necho $blacklist->filter('not-allowed-2');  // => null\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Notes  \r\n\r\n1. Maybe calling the filter class `Whitelist` might be counter-intuitive if the desired behavior is that of a blacklist. But I couldn't think of a better way to name the filter, so I'm open to suggestions:\r\n    * Something like \"AllowedList\" would just be a synonym of \"whitelist\". \r\n    * \"List\" would just be too vague.\r\n    * Separate filter classes seemed overkill.\r\n2. I decided to allow only one type of configuration in the constructor (by array of options) just to keep it simple. If you'd like to allow for a more dynamic constructor (like a few other filters do) let me know.\r\n3. Not sure what commit edbc12b is doing in this PR. Looks like its in `master` but not in `develop`.\r\n\r\nSee #6960 for more info.","created_at":"2014-12-05T16:02:35Z","updated_at":"2015-01-01T15:07:06Z","closed_at":null,"merged_at":null,"merge_commit_sha":"305e637f84c8f628496932bd99c0195a0a503c44","assignee":{"login":"Ocramius","id":154256,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/154256?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius","html_url":"https://github.com/Ocramius","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/Ocramius/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"milestone":{"url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zendframework/zf2/milestones/26","labels_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zendframework/zf2/milestones/26/labels","id":593244,"number":26,"title":"2.4.0","description":null,"creator":{"login":"weierophinney","id":25943,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/25943?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney","html_url":"https://github.com/weierophinney","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/weierophinney/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"open_issues":34,"closed_issues":163,"state":"open","created_at":"2014-03-10T21:38:11Z","updated_at":"2014-12-31T09:55:26Z","due_on":null,"closed_at":null},"commits_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zendframework/zf2/pulls/6962/commits","review_comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zendframework/zf2/pulls/6962/comments","review_comment_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zendframework/zf2/pulls/comments/{number}","comments_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zendframework/zf2/issues/6962/comments","statuses_url":"https://api.github.com/repos/zendframework/zf2/statuses/58ef5245151d935d9031d42a504cfab37297af9e","head":{"label":"gabrielsomoza:gabriel/zf-6960-whitelist-filter","ref":"gabriel/zf-6960-whitelist-filter","sha":"58ef5245151d935d9031d42a504cfab37297af9e","user":{"login":"gabrielsomoza","id":106219,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106219?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielsomoza","html_url":"https://github.com/gabrielsomoza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielsomoza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielsomoza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielsomoza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielsomoza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielsomoza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielsomoza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielsomoza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielsomoza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielsomoza/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"repo":{"id":27590921,"name":"zf2","full_name":"gabrielsomoza/zf2","owner":{"login":"gabrielsomoza","id":106219,"avatar_url":"https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/106219?v=3","gravatar_id":"","url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielsomoza","html_url":"https://github.com/gabrielsomoza","followers_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielsomoza/followers","following_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielsomoza/following{/other_user}","gists_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielsomoza/gists{/gist_id}","starred_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielsomoza/starred{/owner}{/repo}","subscriptions_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielsomoza/subscriptions","organizations_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielsomoza/orgs","repos_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielsomoza/repos","events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielsomoza/events{/privacy}","received_events_url":"https://api.github.com/users/gabrielsomoza/received_events","type":"User","site_admin":false},"private":false,"html_url":"https://github.com/gabrielsomoz

The opposite will happen if value is not in the list.\r\n\r\n### Whitelist\r\n```php\r\n$whitelist = new \\Zend\\Filter\\Whitelist(array(\r\n    'list' => array('allowed-1', 'allowed-2')\r\n));\r\necho $whitelist->filter('allowed-2');   // => 'allowed-2'\r\necho $whitelist->filter('not-allowed'); // => null\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Blacklist\r\n```php\r\n$blacklist = new \\Zend\\Filter\\Whitelist(array(\r\n    'type' => 'blacklist', // optional, default is 'whitelist'\r\n    'list' => array('not-allowed-1', 'not-allowed-2')\r\n));\r\necho $blacklist->filter('allowed');        // => 'allowed'\r\necho $blacklist->filter('not-allowed-2');  // => null\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Notes  \r\n\r\n1. Maybe calling the filter class `Whitelist` might be counter-intuitive if the desired behavior is that of a blacklist. But I couldn't think of a better way to name the filter, so I'm open to suggestions:\r\n    * Something like \"AllowedList\" would just be a synonym of \"whitelist\". \r\n    * \"List\" would just be too vague.\r\n    * Separate filter classes seemed overkill.\r\n2. I decided to allow only one type of configuration in the constructor (by array of options) just to keep it simple. If you'd like to allow for a more dynamic constructor (like a few other filters do) let me know.\r\n3. Not sure what commit edbc12b is doing in this PR. Looks like its in `master` but not in `develop`.\r\n\r\nSee #6960 for more

The page has message \"Please copy this code, switch to your application and paste it there\" with a \"code\" in a textbox. \r\n\r\nIt should logically take me to success call back , however it stays on approval page. Attaching the page. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know , where am I doing mistake. \r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nSagar\r\n![ios simulator screen shot 01-jan-2015 7 44 27 pm](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/2559305/5592350/02da82c8-91f1-11e4-9075-c4de9811c8e4.png)\r\n"}},"public":true,"created_at":"2015-01-01T15:07:21Z"}
